# Firebase Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Still getting `permission_denied` even after updating rules.

## Step 1: Use Completely Open Rules (TEMPORARY)

### Go to Firebase Console
1. Open https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: `block-abd5a`
3. Click "Realtime Database" â†’ "Rules"

### Replace ALL Rules With This (TEMPORARY - FOR TESTING ONLY)
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

### Publish the Rules
1. Click "Publish"
2. Wait for success message

## Step 2: Test the Game
1. Refresh your game page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these messages:
   - "Testing database connection..."
   - "Database write test successful"
   - "Database read test successful"
   - "Database connection test successful"

## Step 3: Check What Happens

### If the test passes but leaderboard still fails:
- The issue is with the leaderboard code, not the rules
- Check console for specific error messages

### If the test fails:
- The Firebase project has a fundamental issue
- Check if the project is active and billing is set up

## Step 4: Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Check Firebase Project Status
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Check if project shows any warnings
3. Verify billing is enabled (if needed)

### Option B: Create a New Firebase Project
If the current project is corrupted:
1. Create a new Firebase project
2. Enable Realtime Database
3. Update the config in the game
4. Use the open rules above

### Option C: Use Local Storage Fallback
If Firebase continues to fail, we can modify the game to:
1. Use localStorage for data
2. Show a message that leaderboard is offline
3. Still allow gameplay

## Step 5: Check Console Logs
After refreshing, look for:
- Any Firebase initialization errors
- Authentication status
- Database connection status
- Specific error codes and messages

## What to Report Back
Please tell me:
1. What happens with the completely open rules
2. What console messages you see
3. Whether the database test passes or fails
4. Any error codes or messages

This will help me identify the exact issue and provide the right solution.
